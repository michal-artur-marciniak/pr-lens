/**
 * The travelling pulse: the mark that says a connection carries traffic
 * rather than merely existing. Both lenses draw it from here, because a
 * reader moving between them is reading one language — an architecture edge
 * and a sequence message differ in what they connect, not in how they live.
 *
 * A line running behind the drawing's clock says so with a negative `begin`,
 * which starts its motion that far into its own turn. A positive delay would
 * describe the same steady state and lie for the seconds after load: an
 * animation has no effect before it begins, so the dot waiting for its turn
 * would sit at the canvas origin, in the corner, in full view.
