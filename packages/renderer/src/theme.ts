/**
 * The one render for a surface that shows a single image and cannot swap on
 * the reader's theme — GitLab and Bitbucket both.
 *
 * Handing such a surface the light asset is what it used to do, and it put a
 * glaring white rectangle in front of every dark-mode reader, with strokes
 * tuned for a light ground washing out against a dark page.
 *
 * A transparent render does not solve it either, and the arithmetic says why:
 * for any flat colour, contrast against white is `1.05 / (L + 0.05)` and
 * against black is `(L + 0.05) / 0.05`, which are equal only at L ≈ 0.179,
 * where both are 4.58:1. That is the ceiling for text meant to sit directly
 * on either page — barely over AA in the best case, and under it against a
 * near-black like #0d1117.
 *
 * So this render is opaque and self-contained: it brings its own ground, and
 * every contrast ratio inside it is fixed regardless of where it lands. The
 * ground is dimmed rather than light — on a dark page it sits naturally, and
 * on a light page it reads as a deliberately dark figure, the way a
 * screenshot or a code block does. Its border is visible against both, so it
 * never bleeds into the page.
